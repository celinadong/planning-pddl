# Planning Domain Definition Language (INFR08010)

Used planning.domains, a PDDL planner, to develop a model of a robotic waiter (agent) that deals with environment features and constraints such as picking up food, bringing it to customers, cleaning the floor...

Employed efficient reasoning, taking into account task constraints of the environment; and developed an efficient plan to solve the real world inference. Project involved defining predicates, initial states and goal states to describe the environment of the agent.
